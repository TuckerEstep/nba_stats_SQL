# NBA Player Stats SQL Project

My goal was to create a SQL-based data exploration project using NBA per-game player stats from the 2024-25 regular season. This project includes a table schema, cleaned dataset .csv file, and a set of example sample queries to analyze players' performance.

# Files Included
-nba_stats.csv - Cleaned dataset of NBA player per game stats for the 2024-25 regular season
-schema.sql - SQL schema to define the 'nba_stats' table
-queries.sql - Sample SQL queries for different insights (Top scorers, best shooters, PRA leaders, etc.)

-----

## How to Use 
1. Create a new database in MySQL Workbench
2. Run 'schema.sql' to create the 'nba_stats' table
3. Import 'nba_player_stats.csv' into 'nba_stats; table
4. Run sample queries from 'queries.sql' or your own queries to explore the data

## Sample Questions Answered

-Who are the top 10 scorers in the league by PPG?
-Which players shoot the best from the 3?
-Who are the assist and Rebound leaders?
-Which players lead in total PRA?
-What players average the most PPG Per36
